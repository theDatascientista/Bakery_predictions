# Baseline Model

Best performing linear model: Linear_regression_2 Lin_Reg4

Used variables: Warengruppe, Wochentag, Temperatur

## Overview

The purpose of this stage is to establish a baseline model for your project. A baseline model is a simple model that serves as a point of comparison for any subsequent, more complex models you may build.

## Guidelines

Implement linear regression model and provide information on the following issues:

- **Feature Selection**
    We tried quite some feature combinations but this one seemed to work best

- **Implementation**

- **Evaluation**
    The Kaggle score was still not good but acceptable for a linear regression
